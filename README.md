Dataset Overview: Analyzed aviation accident data since 1919, focusing on trends, causes, and fatalities across different countries.

Notable Findings:
- Argentina has 40 more accidents than South Africa over the 104-year period, averaging only 0.38 additional accidents annually.
- The Andes mountain range may contribute to Argentina's higher fatality mean of 4.6 compared to South Africa's 2.4.
- The deadliest incidents include a Douglas DC-6 crash in 1961 (Argentina) and a Tupolev Tu-134A-3 crash in 1986 (South Africa).

Visuals: 
-A comparison plot and top 10 aircraft type bar chart.

this is my first EDA analysis took the data off Kaggle took  a sample of all accidents since 1919 did an EDA analysis on them using MATPLOTLIb, Python, Pandas and Numpy. 

not so familiar with Git as an aspiring Data Analysist/ scientist so please forgive any github errors
